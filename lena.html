        Field recording is the term used for an audio recording produced outside a recording studio, 
        and the term applies to recordings of both natural and human-produced sounds. 
        It also applies to sound recordings like electromagnetic fields or vibrations using different microphones 
        like a passive magnetic antenna for electromagnetic recordings or contact microphones. 
        For underwater field recordings a field recordist uses hydrophones to capture the sounds of wales, dolphins or movements.
        These recordings are very useful for sound designers.</p>
