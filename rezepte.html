    <P>
      I guess for the recipes i would like to have a blog style to begin with.
      Have a title a Picture and show the beginning of the ingredients.
      Then a link to a single page with recipe. maybe "continue reading" like will
      or he picture could be a link?! not sure yet. 
      Eventually I might want to add a homepage.
