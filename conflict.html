            One is from the Robert Strauss Center for International Security and Law.
            It's a link to a post from August 2016 regarding the release of new data for Africa and Latin America. 
            As part of the Strauss Centerâ€™s Climate Change and African Political Stability (CCAPS) program, the Social Conflict Analysis Database (SCAD) team released updated data for Africa and Latin America covering conflicts through December 2015. The SCAD research project is led by Strauss Center senior fellows Cullen Hendrix and Idean Salehyan.
            SCAD includes protests, riots, strikes, inter-communal conflict, government violence against civilians, and other forms of social conflict not systematically tracked in other conflict datasets. Each event record contains information on the location, timing, and magnitude of social conflict events, as well as the actors, targets, issues of contention, and government response. While other data sources contain rich information about armed conflict in Africa and other regions, the goal of the SCAD project is to provide researchers, journalists, NGOs, and the policy community more detail about other forms of social conflict.

            The Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED) is a disaggregated data collection, analysis, and crisis mapping project. ACLED collects the dates, actors, locations, fatalities, and modalities of all reported political violence and protest events across Africa, South Asia, Southeast Asia, the Middle East, Central Asia and the Caucasus, and Southeastern and Eastern Europe and the Balkans. The ACLED team conducts analysis to describe, explore, and test conflict scenarios, and makes both data and analysis open for free use by the public.
